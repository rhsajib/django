**Event Planning and Ticketing Platform**

Description: Build an event planning and ticketing platform where event organizers can create and manage events, and users can discover and purchase tickets for various events.

Here's a breakdown of the key features and components:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Implement user registration and authentication using Django Rest Framework. Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profile information.

2. **Event Creation and Management**: Develop API endpoints that allow event organizers to create, update, and manage events. Include fields such as event title, description, location, date, time, ticket prices, and availability. Implement authorization checks to ensure only authorized organizers can manage their events.

3. **Event Listing and Search**: Build APIs to retrieve and display a list of upcoming events. Allow users to search for events based on criteria like location, date, category, or keywords. Implement pagination and sorting options for a better user experience.

4. **Ticket Purchase and Management**: Create endpoints for users to browse and purchase tickets for events. Implement a shopping cart system that allows users to add tickets, update quantities, and proceed to checkout. Integrate with payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal for secure payment processing.

5. **Ticket Scanning and Validation**: Build functionality to validate and scan tickets at the event venue. Implement QR code scanning or barcode validation mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of tickets.

6. **User Reviews and Ratings**: Include features for users to leave reviews and ratings for events they have attended. Allow users to provide feedback, rate the event experience, and leave comments.

7. **Event Categories and Filtering**: Implement a system to categorize events based on different genres or types. Allow users to filter events by category, making it easier to discover events of interest.

8. **Event Recommendations**: Develop a recommendation system that suggests events to users based on their preferences, past attendance, or popular events in their area. Utilize user behavior analysis and collaborative filtering techniques to generate personalized recommendations.

9. **Social Sharing and Integration**: Enable social sharing of events on popular social media platforms. Integrate with social media APIs to allow users to share events with their friends and followers.

10. **Analytics and Reporting**: Implement analytics and reporting features for event organizers. Provide insights into ticket sales, attendee demographics, and event performance. Generate reports and visualizations to help organizers make data-driven decisions.

11. **Testing and Deployment**: Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of your APIs. Deploy your application to a hosting provider like Heroku or AWS and set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines for smooth updates and testing.

Building an event planning and ticketing platform using Django and Django Rest Framework will demonstrate your skills in creating complex data models, handling user authentication and authorization, and integrating with external services. It also provides an opportunity to focus on user experience, search functionality, and payment processing. Good luck with your project!
